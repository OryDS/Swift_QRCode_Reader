You'll see how to save data on a web server by sending some values from an iOS application to the MySQL database.

Before using this iOS project, you need to have a development environment like MAMP or XAMPP to get a remote server with MySQL database and write the PHP script on it.
Remember that you need to sort your server settings in the PHP file like Hosting, Username, Password, DB Name and Table.
